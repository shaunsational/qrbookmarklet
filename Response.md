# Overwhelmed #

When I originally created this it was to quickly load sites into mobile & tablet devices to test layouts (I'm a web developer).  While it is public I never promoted it or anything.

I logged in a few days ago to update qrbookmarklet for use on https sites.  I noticed there were bug reports that I had never addressed because I never set up the project correctly to email me.

after googling the project url I was shocked to see how much this has been passed around the net.  I never expected that to happen but hey I guess it did.

It seemed like the biggest issue with it was that when QR'ing google maps it only loaded the base url and not the specific zoom level / location (which I have added today March 20th, 2012) but there was never any entry for this in the issues.  While I wouldn't have known about the issues until I logged in anyway (now its set up properly to email me new issues) I would never know to fix them in the first place.

I want to be better at fixing issues in my code, so if you have an issue with something please [submit a bug](http://code.google.com/p/qrbookmarklet/issues/entry) and I will do my best to fix it.

I also started a [Changelog](ChangeLog.md) that shows what has been added
